# Introduction

## What is Cublex Labs?

Cublex Labs is a multi-disciplinary software studio focused on developing plugins, servers, apps, and indie games.
It operates like a technical R&D lab — small, agile, experimental — shipping products across several categories:

- Minecraft Plugins
- ~~Hytale Plugins~~ (SOON)
- ~~Mobile Apps~~ (SOON)
- ~~Indie Games~~ (SOON)

## What is Cub0.jar?

Cub0 is our powerful core library that serves as the foundation for all Cub plugins. It provides essential features like:

- Common utilities and tools
- Cross-plugin compatibility
- Native localization system
- Unified logging and debugging system
- Unified client-side lore system
- Protocol string replacer
- Protocol glow effect (SOON)
- AI Features (SOON)
- RESTful API (SOON)

Think of Cub0 as the engine that drives all Cub plugins. While it needs to be installed as a separate plugin, this modular approach ensures better performance, easier updates, and reduced redundancy across our plugin ecosystem.

## How do I install Cub0.jar?

To install Cub0, simply place the Cub0 plugin file into your server’s `/plugins/` directory and restart your server. Cub0 requires [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to work properly—be sure to download and install the latest version if you don’t already have it.

You can get the latest Cub0 release from [GitHub](https://github.com/), [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/), [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/), or [Polymart](https://polymart.org/).

## Where can I buy the plugins?

All plugins are available on [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/394490/), [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/search/member?user_id=621438) and Polymart.
