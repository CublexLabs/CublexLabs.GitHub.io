# Dialog Types

There are 3 types of dialogs you can create with CubDialogs:

**notice**: Dialogs with `body`, `input(s)` and 1 `exit_button`.
**confirmation**: Dialogs designed to gather player input, consisting of a `body`, one or more `input(s)`, and two `exit_buttons`: `confirm` and `cancel`.
**multi_action**: Dialogs that allow multiple actions, such as selecting from several options or performing batch operations. Includes a `body`, one or more `input(s)`, multiple `buttons` for different actions, and 1 `exit_button`.
