# Common Settings

> **Note:** You can copy and use a configuration from the auto-generated templates under the CubDialogs folder.

These are the common settings across all dialogs types. (notice, confirmation, multi_action)

## Keys

### 1. Type

```
type: "notice"
```

Type can be `notice`, `confirmation` or `multi_action`.

### 2. Title and External Title

```

> **Note:** The `dialog_list` dialog type is unavailable for now.

### 3. Close with ESC

```
